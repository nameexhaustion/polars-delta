# polars-delta

Native Delta Lake scan planning for Polars. This repository builds the `polars_delta`
Python extension and exports the `polars.io_plugin.delta.v1` planning contract. The same Rust crate exposes
`polars_delta::codec` for native deletion-vector decoding without planner features.

The planner reads Delta logs and checkpoints through host-provided storage, and returns
snapshot schema, active files, partition values, statistics and deletion-vector descriptors.
Polars reads the data files and applies predicates and deletion vectors. Unsupported reader
features produce an explicit unsupported-feature result; malformed metadata is an error.

## Workspace setup

Keep this repository at `crates/polars-delta` inside a compatible Polars checkout.
The parent workspace discovers it through `crates/*`; it inherits workspace metadata,
lints and dependency versions. Its package version is independent of Polars. It is not a
standalone checkout: Cargo still resolves optional dependencies and workspace metadata when
planner features are disabled.

The Rust package and library are `polars-delta` and `polars_delta`. The Python distribution
and import module are `polars-delta` and `polars_delta`. Enable the `python` Cargo feature
for the extension module; maturin enables it automatically.

Run Cargo checks from the parent workspace. Build wheels with maturin using this
repository's `pyproject.toml`. Raw maturin source archives include the required dependency
sources and need no workspace-normalization step. Follow the host checkout's build/offload
instructions.

## Integration

A compatible Polars build selects the installed plugin automatically. Set
`POLARS_DELTA_PLANNER=plugin` to require it, or `POLARS_DELTA_PLANNER=deltalake` to use
the compatibility planner. Automatic mode may fall back for unsupported features;
requiring the plugin reports them directly. `use_pyarrow=True` and writes still use deltalake.

The module advertises supported contracts through `_polars_io_plugin_ids`; `_capsule`
returns the selected contract. Contract compatibility, rather than the package version
alone, determines whether a Polars build can load the plugin.

This development implementation requires a matching Polars build. The host and plugin must be released together
with compatible contracts; installing this development source alone does not add plugin
support to older Polars builds.

## Feature separation

Default features are empty. The always-available `polars_delta::codec` module validates Delta
deletion-vector framing and decodes portable Roaring data into packed keep bits. Its only
direct non-standard-library dependency is `crc32fast`. The host depends on `polars-delta` with default
features disabled; it keeps storage credentials, lazy range reads, pruning and reader scheduling.
The Python planning plugin remains optional at runtime.

The `planner` feature enables snapshot planning and its Arrow/Parquet, storage-interface and
other planning dependencies. The `python` feature includes `planner` and the Python extension;
maturin enables it through `pyproject.toml`. A workspace build selecting the extension can unify
features with the host dependency, so check the minimal build independently:

```bash
cargo test -p polars-delta --no-default-features
cargo test -p polars-delta --no-default-features --features planner
```

The codec caller supplies the maximum row bound and performs storage reads. Validate the file
header before fetching a stored frame; inline/frame decoding validates sizes, CRC where present,
cardinality and portable Roaring contents. Results own packed least-significant-bit-first keep
bits and a logical length; rows beyond that length are kept. The serialized input bound is
512 MiB. Per-mask bounds do not bound aggregate memory across readers.

This package retains `publish = false`. Disabling planner features does not remove optional
planner dependencies from Cargo registry resolution, including the unpublished host FFI package.
Rust registry publication needs a separate release design; Python wheels and source distributions
are built from the matching workspace sources.
